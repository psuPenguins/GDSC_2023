WalkWatch is an Android app designed to keep pedestrians safe while walking by providing a routing feature that can identify and alert users of potential hazards. The app uses Android Studio, Java, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Storage, Google Clouds, and Maps SDK for Android. Current features include marking hazards, filtering marks, and displaying markers as pins on the map. Future features include creating routes that display hazards, using machine learning to find the safest route for handicap people, and implementing auto warnings. 

Built by four students from Pennsylvania State University during 2023, this project was built to compete in the 2023 Google Solution Challenge.

Goals that WalkWatch meets:
- [X] Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing
- Target 3.6: Reduce road injuries and deaths
  - Our app offers pedestrians a safer route-finding solution, ultimately decreasing the number of pedestrian accidents.


- [X] Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- Target 11.2: Affordable and sustainable transport systems
  - Our app is designed to assist people with disabilities in finding the most convenient routes for them, making pedestrian navigation more accessible and inclusive.
- Target 11.6: Reduce the environmental impacts of cities
  - Our app aims to improve the accessibility of safe walkways for pedestrians and incentivize walking through a rewards program, ultimately increasing pedestrian activity and reducing air pollution caused by vehicular transportation.
- Target 11.7: Provide access to safe and inclusive green and public spaces
  - Our app will enhance the accessibility of safe walkways for pedestrians by providing them with up-to-date information on the condition of public spaces.



- [X] Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- Target 12.8: Promote universal understanding of sustainable lifestyles
  - By encouraging people to walk more frequently, our app promotes a healthier lifestyle and improves overall well-being.
